# Personal Motivation For The Project
My family has always been keen on education and teaching.
As a matter of fact we have 4 teachers:
* My grandmother - an elementary school teacher (retired)
* My aunt - a French teacher (retired)
* My sister - a Spanish and Bulgarian teacher (active)
* Myself - a Math teacher (avoiding at all costs)

With this project I'm aiming to help out my sister's students
master reading comprehension by doing a summary on the texts
they are studying. The project can be used whenever the students
face difficulties or to verify their understanding.
